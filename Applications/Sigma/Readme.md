# Situated Interactive Guidance Monitoring and Assistance

## Brief Introduction

Situated Interactive Guidance Monitoring and Assistance (in short SIGMA) is an open-source research prototype system intended to enable research on mixed-reality task assistive agents. The current implementation leverages the sensing and rendering capabilities of the HoloLens 2 headset in conjunction with large language and vision models to guide users step by step through procedural tasks.

SIGMA is built on top of [Platform for Situated Intelligence](https://github.com/microsoft/psi) and provides several affordances that support and accelerate research and experimentation at the intersection of mixed-reality and AI:

* client-server architecture (sensing and rendering on device, but compute offloaded to a desktop server) enables bypassing existing on-device compute limitations
* modular design allowing for swapping in and out components and models in the context of an end-to-end application
* extensive and performant data logging infrastructure
* data visualization via Platform for Situated Intelligence Studio
* extensible architecture that allows for targeting other devices

We hope SIGMA can accelerate research at the intersection of mixed-reality and AI and help chart a path towards community-driven evaluation of large language, vision, and multimodal models in the context of an end-to-end, real-world, interactive mixed-reality application.

## Transparency Notes

To enable responsible AI use and development, system transparency notes for SIGMA are available [here](https://github.com/microsoft/psi/wiki/Sigma-Transparency-Note). These transparency notes are intended to help you understand how SIGMA works, what are the system's intended uses, what are its limitations and risks, and the choices researchers can make that influence system performance and behavior. Please read these carefully before using the system in your own research.
